# ReEntryApp  Overview
> “Sidekick” Tools to Reduce Recidivism

# Background

In recent years Judge Aiken, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District Court of Oregon, has implemented an innovative re-entry program in which all parties to the criminal justice system collaborate with the re-entering individual to try to reduce recidivist behavior. Participants in this program have demonstrated a 16% reduction in recidivism as compared with participants in standard re-entry programs.

# Project/Application Summary

Build prototype technological overlay of Judge Aiken’s innovative re-entry/recidivism prevention program.  The project will have two functional pieces: (1) a court-facing or parole officer-facing dashboard module that will allow the court/parole officer to track the individual’s progress, real-time movements, and to provide timely strategic interventions to help reduce recidivism, and (2) a participant-facing module, most likely in the form of an application developed for a mobile platform (currently expected to be Andriod), that will enable and empower program participants to succeed in their re-entry journey.     

# Project Participants

The project consists of three main groups:

1) Stakeholder Committee: This committee will oversee development of the project. The stakeholder committee will be the ultimate “recipient” and owner of the project and will see to its long-term management and adoption. The stakeholder committee will likely be chaired by Judge Ann Aiken of the Oregon Federal District Court.

2) Expert/Advisory Committee: This committee will provide guidance and feedback on specific aspects of the project as may be needed in development and roll-out. The sole committee member of this project at this time is Rebecca Henshaw, Judge Aiken’s deputy. This panel will consist of experts to advise the project team on the application itself. We expect that these will be individuals familiar with principles underlying the application such as the reentry/parole process, data privacy, rehabilitation, professional development, mental health and others.

3) Project Team: The project team will see development of the project through, at least, the initial design and prototyping of the project. The project team has the longest-standing relationship with the project.  The project team will also likely include the developers who will do some of the heavy lifting in actually coding the project.

# Project Development

## 1) Phase 1: 

a. Project Initiation. 

This phase has two aspects. Empaneling the two committees necessary for project and kick-off.

b. Empanel Steering Committee and Expert Advisory Panel:

i. Steering Committee: Judge Aiken has identified Mark Sherman as one potential member of the Steering Committee.

ii. Expert Advisory Panel: Any member of the Steering Committee or Project Team can and should nominate members of this panel. MIT will propose several top technical experts for this panel. Rebecca Henshaw is point of contact for the subject matter experts who will serve on this panel. Ms. Henshaw will help identify the best contacts to provide guidance on topics deemed that need to be considered by the advisory panel.

c. Kick-off:

i. Schedule and hold a kick-off meeting to validate current project design, conduct additional project design, confirm schedule and otherwise direct project.

## 2) Phase2: Development:

a. The development process will be conducted by the following groups/roles:

i. Developers. Once the project committees above have been properly empanelled the project team will work to recruit and support developers to build a prototype, alpha, and or beta version of the application/program.

ii. Project Team. The project team will work to execute the project by coordinating with the developers and the expert advisory panel, facilitating direct communication between the developers and the expert advisory panel, communicating status and otherwise collaborating with the Steering Committee.

iii. Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will oversee development and, hopefully, broader promotion of the project.

## 3) Phase 3: Delivery:

a. Upon completion, the project team will present and deliver the completed project to the Steering Committee. Delivery will include:

i. Final Presentation and Opportunity for Pilot-Phase Launch

ii. Account transfer and ownership assignment of the GitHub Project. All project data (both public and private) including work flow (i.e. via issues tickets, authorization roles for accounts of contributors and other participants, open source licenses, etc) will be transitioned to Steering Committee or its designee.

iii. Hand-Off. The hand-off will include a Google Hangout for a “final presentation” using slides, screen share, video and/or other online methods to walk through the deliverables and repositories, discuss/questions.
 

# Project Timeline:
