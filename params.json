For more [background and an informal overview, see this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ckx4aS00vA&feature=share&t=1h33m50s) of Team Members Dan Lear, Joshua Lenon and Dazza Greenwood discussing the ReEntryApp project at the MIT LegalScienceSalon.  \r\n\r\n# People\r\n\r\n## ReEntryApp Catalyst:\r\n\r\n**The Honorable [Judge Ann Aiken, Chief Judge of the Federal  District Court of Oregon](http://www.ord.uscourts.gov/index.php/our-judges/judge-aiken-sub)**\r\n\r\nJudge Aiken launched the District of Oregon's [Reentry Court](http://www.ord.uscourts.gov/index.php/public/reentry-court), a pilot program for drug offenders, in partnership with U.S. Probation, the U.S. Attorney's office, the Federal Defender's office, private and non-profit community organizations, and others.\r\n\r\nJudge Aiken [called for the creation of a mobile app](http://legalhackathon.net/2014/02/10/federal-judge-aiken-calls-for-an-app-legal-hackers-answer) for to support and enhance participantion in the Reentry Court program.  Judge Aiken posed that innovation challenge to the [Data Privacy Legal Hackathon] held in Brooklyn, NY the weekend of February 8th, 2014. Several individual participants at the event answered the call and formed a team together to develop a conceptual design and architecture for the app.  When all projects were presented and judged at the conclusion of the event, the team's design and proposed approach won second place.  \r\n\r\nAnd so it was that the ReEntryApp project was formed.  \r\n\r\n## ReEntryApp Project Team:\r\n\r\n[Dan Lear](@rightbrainlaw); Team Member and Project Point of Contact Designated for Judge Aiken \r\n\r\n[Joshua Lenon](@joshualenon); Team Member\r\n\r\nJoyce Searls; Team Member [Bio](http://customercommons.org/about-us)\r\n\r\n[Ray Campbell](rac3); Team Affiliate\r\n\r\n[Lina Kaisey](@linakaisey); Team Member\r\n\r\n[Dazza Greenwood](@dazzaji); Team Member and Project Host/Facilitator for MIT Media Lab\r\n\r\n### _Thanks for the Pages_\r\nThis webpage is provisioned using the free [GitHub Pages](http://help.github.com/pages) service.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
